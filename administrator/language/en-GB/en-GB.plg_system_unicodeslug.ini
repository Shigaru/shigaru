PLG_UNICODESLUG_DESCRIPTION=<strong>Enable this plugin to obtain unicode slugs when using Joomla native SEF.</strong></p><p>What about getting in Joomla!™ accented urls (for those using a latin alphabet) or with your own language glyphs (in Greek, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Persian, etc.)?<br />Until now Joomla was only proposing ASCII urls when using its native SEF. Titles (articles, menu items, etc.) were replaced by a date in the alias when written in a non-latin alphabet.<br /><br />Grace to this system plugin, we have no more transliteration, spaces as well as special forbidden characters are transformed to hyphens.<br /><br />Wikipedia demonstrates this in Persian:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ps.wikipedia.org/wiki/فارسي">http://ps.wikipedia.org/wiki/فارسي</a><br />is in fact:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ps.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%8A">http://ps.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%8A<br /></a><br />Google has no problem searching or referencing such links.<br /><br />The url to an article describing this plugin functionnalities is <a target="_blank" href="http://info-graf.fr/infografcvs/Des-urls-de-toute-beauté.html">http://info-graf.fr/infografcvs/Des-urls-de-toute-beauté.html</a><br />Caps as well as the accented letters are kept in the url.<br /><br /><strong>Tip</strong>: Browsers behave differently when copying such urls. Firefox will copy the unicode format while Opera will get the original glyphs.<br /><br /><strong>Caution:</strong> <br /><ol><li>This plugin loads a modified version of the class « jfilteroutput » (libraries/joomla/filter/filteroutput.php). While this class has not been modified since 2007/03/15, it could be in the future and therefore necessitate an update of this plugin.</li><li>Some 3pd extensions may have modified this class for their own needs through JExtend. Therefore, there could be incompatibility as this plugin loads last.<br /></li></ol>
