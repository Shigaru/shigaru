Watch  Brandon Slavinski teach you how to play &#34;Lucky&#34; by Jason Mraz  on the Guitar. Each guitar player and new guitar student develops their own personal style and form as they learn to play over time. Developing some technical skills, like an understanding of tablature, and perhaps studying music theory, notation and rhythm are all important to becoming an accomplished musician. How quickly a certain student learns the guitar will also depend on individual talent and personal dedication to the craft. Practicing songs that are familiar and fun to play for friends can be a motivational inspiration for many guitar students.
