This file is about which features MeWiG should get in the future...
(and which are already done)

Working:
- single source/file encoding
- (basic) cropping, scaling, deinterlacing.
- audio-encoding using mp3lame
- video-encoding using ffmpeg
- 2 pass-encoding
- Bitrate-calculator
- script export
- thread-priority ("nicing")
- shutdown
- multiple file-sources (long scripts ;) )
- dvd sources
- auto-cropping (remove black borders)
- autosense for filters (get res/aspect from mplayer, fix by 16, etc.)
- local dvd (from dir, not disc) usage
- xvid-support
- ogg/ogm - support
- ivtc

Todo:
- "profiles"
- svcd-sources
- preview-window for filters (show bitmap)
- 3pass encoding (auto-bitrate)
- min. bitrate (more discs)
