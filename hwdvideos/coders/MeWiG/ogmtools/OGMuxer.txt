     --simulate          just tell you where it should cut
     --chapters <id>     what to do with chapters
                          (id is binary flags)
                  bit 1 -> throw away chapters belonging to previous part
                  bit 2 -> throw away chapters belonging to next parts
                  bit 3 -> keep the last chapter of the previous part
     --title "..."       title
     --titles n ...      titles for each part (n titles)
     --frames "frm"      define frames where to cut

Nb :
 - Reprocessing of audio streams is disabled by default
 - "--chapters 0" means keep all the chapters
 - "--chapters 1" means throw away chapters belonging to previous parts
 - "--chapters 2" means throw away chapters belonging to next parts
 - "--chapters 3" means "--chapters 1" & "--chapters 2"
 - "--chapters 4" means keep the last chapter of the previous part (equivalent to "--chapters 0")
 - "--chapters 5" means "--chapters 1" & "--chapters 4"
 - "--chapters 6" means "--chapters 2" & "--chapters 4"
 - "--chapters 7" means "--chapters 1" & "--chapters 2" & "--chapters 4"
 - default behaviour is "--chapters 7"
 - using the "--frames" option will disable the default behaviour regarding title
   If you want titles to be changed, just use the --title option after the --frames option
 - "frm" contains list of frame number and/or time (??:??:??.???] separated by spaces
 - using the "--parts" option may result in a last part bigger than your split size
 - you can use <size>K and size <size>M to precise Kilo/Mega Bytes


Exemple :
 OGMuxer -f -o "C:\My Directory\OutputFile.ogm"  "C:\My Directory\InputFile1.avi" "C:\My Directory\InputFile2.ogg"
will
 - open InputFile1.avi and InputFile2.ogg
 - create OutputFile.ogm (deleting it if already exists)
 - mux the input streams into OutputFile.ogm
 
 If all went well, you should have seen :
 ...
 Status in ... : new Packetizer created (handling ...)
 (n times, where n is the number of input streams)
 ...
 ...
 Status in ... : EOS reached
 (n times too)
 ...
 
 
 valid input types are :
 - standard AVI video stream (also audio streams : new in v0.9a6)
 - standard Ogg/Ogm file
 - standard AC3 file
 - standard MP3 file
 - standard SRT file
 - standard WAV file (new in v0.9a6)
 
New in version 0.9a2 :
 Use the -s option to precise an automatisation setup file (same as OggMux).
 
New in version 0.9a6 :
- Audio streams in AVI file are now processed. WAV format added as input (using VirtualDub
  reading routines :) ).
- Audio streams (MP3 and AC3) coming from an AVI or WAV file can be "reprocessed".
What does that mean ?
You may know that AVI container (and also WAV) are not really meant to contain VBR streams.
With latest versions of VirtualDub, a warning tell you about such problems. If you save
this AVI file thanks to VirtualDub, you may experience synchonisation problems with the
resulting AVI file. It is exactly the same when processing audio streams coming from
AVI or WAV file in OGMuxer (of course since I use VirtualDub routines ;) ). However
I added the possiblity to treat those streams separately (as if they were coming from
a normal AC3 or MP3 file), which should solve the problem (since OGMuxer normally
correctly handle VBR MP3 or AC3).
This of course add some extra steps in stream processing within OGMuxer, which
means OGMuxer will be slower than if you don't reprocess those streams, wiil need
more memory and may encounter more problems also.

By default this option is disabled. Use -r in commandline to enable this option.

New in version 1.0a1 :
Added same options than OGMCutter, allowing to split the OGM file.
Each file's name will end with " - Part %n%.ogm" where %n% is the number of the part.

OGMuxer should do the following with your comments :
 - The TITLE comment will end with the " - Part %n%" string where %n% is the number
   of the part being written
 - The CHAPTER's times should be adjusted corresponding to the beginning time of
   the part being written. If a CHAPTER belongs to a previous part, then its time
   is set to 0 (it's the most convenient way I found)

In other words, suppose you have a 2.1GB file, that the TITLE you used is
 "The title of my big file", that the video lasts 3 hours, that you have
3 chapters at 01:00:00.000, 02:00:00.000 and 03:00:00.000, and that OGMuxer
found cut points @ 702MB (01:00:00.000) and 1404MB (02:00:00.000) making
3 parts of each 702MB (well if you have a case like that you must have did it
on purpose ;)), then you should end with this :

- File "C:\My Big File - Part 1.ogm", 702MB
  Title : "The title of my big file - Part 1"
  Chapters : Chapter 1 @ 01:00:00.000
             Chapter 2 @ 02:00:00.000
             Chapter 3 @ 03:00:00.000
             
- File "C:\My Big File - Part 2.ogm", 702MB
  Title : "The title of my big file - Part 2"
  Chapters : Chapter 1 @ 00:00:00.000
             Chapter 2 @ 01:00:00.000
             Chapter 3 @ 02:00:00.000
             
- File "C:\My Big File - Part 3.ogm", 702MB
  Title : "The title of my big file - Part 3"
  Chapters : Chapter 1 @ 00:00:00.000
             Chapter 2 @ 00:00:00.000
             Chapter 3 @ 01:00:00.000

For "throwing away" chapters not belonging to a part, change the "--chapters #"
option (see "OGMuxer -h").
For preventing OGMCutter from changing the video title, use the "--title" option.

You can specify a maximum number of parts to create by using the --parts option.

You can also specify specific points in the clip where to cut.
For doing so you must use the --frames option. Points can be specified either by frame
number (frame 0 = first frame) or by time (HH:MM:SS.mmmmm format).
The points given in parameter will be used to define subsets to keep or throw.
First frame of a subset is kept, last one is thrown.
The first part (from the beginning of the clip till the first point given in parameter)
will be skipped, and every other part (on two) will be kept.
Example :
  OGMuxer --frames "1000 00:59:00.00000 80000 01:30:00.00000"
will define 5 subsets :
 -> Subset 1 : Beginning of the clip -> frame 1000     => THROWN
 -> Subset 2 : frame 1000 -> time 00:59:00.00000       => KEPT
 -> Subset 3 : time 00:59:00.00000 -> frame 75000      => THROWN
 -> Subset 4 : frame 75000 -> time 01:30:00.00000      => KEPT
 -> Subset 5 : time 01:30:00.00000 -> End of the clip  => THROWN
When a subset is KEPT, it can end on any frame
When a subset is THROWN, the next subset will begin on the first keyframe previous
to the end of the subset.
For KEPT subsets :
  If the end of the subset is located before the beginning of this subset, this subset
  is considered as useless and removed.
For THROWN subsets :
  If the keyframe found (see above) is located before (or at the same position) the
  beginning of this subset, the program will change both Beginning and End of the
  subset to the first keyframe next to the beginning of the subset. This will force
  OGMCutter to split on this keyframe.
  In this case, and if the subset is the first one, this specifically mean that you
  will keep the beginning of the clip.
So if the clip was a 25fps one, we would have (in frames) :
 -> Subset 1 : Beginning of the clip -> frame 1000     => THROWN
 -> Subset 2 : frame 1000 -> frame 88500               => KEPT
 -> Subset 3 : frame 85000 -> frame 75000              => THROWN
 -> Subset 4 : frame 75000 -> time 135000              => KEPT
 -> Subset 5 : frame 135000 -> End of the clip         => THROWN
Suppose that first keyframe previous to frame 1000 is the first frame (0).
Subset 3 is not valid, and suppose the first keyframe previous to frame 85000 is
frame 84750.
Then OGMuxer will really work on those subsets :
 -> Subset 1 : Beginning of the clip -> frame 1000     => THROWN
 -> Subset 2 : frame 0 -> frame 84750                  => KEPT
 -> Subset 3 : frame 84750 -> frame 84750              => THROWN
 -> Subset 4 : frame 84750 -> time 135000              => KEPT
 -> Subset 5 : frame 135000 -> End of the clip         => THROWN
Subset 1 will be ignored (as useless) and Subset 3 means a split will be forced
on keyframe 84750.

You can still use --parts and/or --split options together with the --frames option.
In this case the --parts and/or --split options will be applied on each KEPT subset.


New in version 1.0a8 :
The --title option is now :
 --title "The title of my clip{{ what i want to add for part %n}}"
Where the "{{...}}" block is used when cutting/splitting in more then one part.
This block is not necessary (this allow you to use a fixed title). The "%n" string
in this block will be replaced by the part number.
You can also use the option
 --titles n "title 1" ... "title n"
This option allow you to precise specific titles for the first n parts you
will get by cutting/splitting. Each title is processed like the main title
(i.e. you can also use the "{{...}}" block).

So for each part written :
 - if no title have been precised by the user, use the original one
 - if a specific title have been precised for the part, use this one
 - if no specific title have been precised, but a main one, use the main one


New in version 1.1a1 :
The setup file is now parsed using a really basic XML-like parser.
The standard .omx specs can still be used (except that now you are not
bound to the very restrictive formatting of those files ;)).
For an example of the new format you can use, see Setup-New.omx
Text values must be kind of HTML-like. This means you have the following
correspondances :
 Normal -> HTML
  '&'      &amp;   (necessary)
  '<'      &lt;    (idem)
  '>'      &gt;    (idem)
  '"'      &quot;  (necessary for attributes)
 '™'(tm)   &trade; (both normal and translated text should work)
  '©'      &copy;  (idem)
  '®'      &reg;   (idem)
This is why I call it HTML-like (there should be much more
correspondances but I am too lazy to put them all ;)).

 
 Restrictions :
  - there is no real stream error detection, so if your source files are corrupted,
    the program should end the processing of the correspondant stream, but I don't
    know what could happen, hence the "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!".
    
Technical notes :
How does OGMuxer works ?
First point, it read data coming from input files thanks to Reader objects.
As each type of file has a specific structure, each type of file has its proper
Reader (AVIReader for AVI files, AC3Reader for AC3 files, ...).
To construct Pages using the Ogg layer, we need to construct Packets containing
a certain amount of samples (sample = frame for video, sample for audio, and ms
for text), give those Packets to the Ogg layer, and wait Pages in return (when
enough data have been sent). This is the role of the Packetizer object.
So the Reader get data coming from the input file, give those data to the correct
Packetizer (one Packetizer per stream), and wait for Pages in return.
To control all the Reader created (one per input file), there is an object
called OGMuxer. It controls each Reader have not reached EOF, and that it can
give Pages to write into the output file. It also determines the order in which
those Pages should be written into the file (so that you can at the end play
the ogm file without too much stuttering ;) ).
So suppose you use three input files :
 - File1.avi : AVI file containing a video stream and 1 audio stream
 - File2.ogg : Ogg file
 - File3.srt : SRT file
Then after having initialized everything, we have the following objects working :
                       
                        /-->Packetizer (AVI video stream)
         /-->AVIReader--|
         |              \-->Packetizer (AVI audio stream)
OGMuxer--|                  
         |-->OGMReader----->Packetizer (Ogg Vorbis stream)
         |
         \-->SRTReader----->Packetizer (SRT subtitle stream)

Some of you will notice this is very similar to the way ogmtools (developped by
Moritz Bunkus) works. And this is normal since my tools are inspired by his tools :).

Now what does the audio reprocessing mean here ?
Before going further, I must tell that a Reader doesn't directly read data from a file.
It uses an object called InputStream. A derived class that uses a file as input
is the InputFile object, which is what we give to the Reader.
There is another derived class that uses a Reader as "input", which is the Stream_Reader
object, and which is what we will use for reprocessing.
Suppose the audio stream in AVI is an AC3 one, and that you enabled audio reprocessing.
Then the AVIReader will create an AC3Reader object and give it a Stream_Reader (the input
of this Stream_Reader is the AVIReader) as input. When processing the AVI file, if
data belong to the AC3 stream, those data won't be sent to the Packetizer, but
given to this Stream_Reader instead (the Packetizer is now a Fake one since it
should not process anything).
Then the AVIReader will ask the OGMuxer object to add this new Reader, which give :


                        /-->Packetizer (AVI video stream)
         /-->AVIReader--|
         |              \-->Packetizer (AVI audio stream - Fake)
OGMuxer--|                  
         |-->OGMReader----->Packetizer (Ogg Vorbis stream)
         |
         |-->SRTReader----->Packetizer (SRT subtitle stream)
         |
         \-->AC3Reader----->Packetizer (AVI audio stream - AC3)

So what happens in OGMuxer now ?
OGMuwer verify each Reader have not reached EOF and that it has Pages that
can be written into the output file. 
For each Reader, if it is not EOF, and that no Pages are ready, OGMuxer ask
the Reader to prepare Pages. The Reader then read data coming from its
InputStream, and give the data to the correct Packetizer (or the Stream_Reader
when needed) till Pages are ready to be written.
The new AC3Reader will so ask data to the Stream_Reader. If the AVIReader gave
enough data to the Stream_Reader, all is fine. If not then the Stream_Reader
will ask the AVIReader to read more data (if possible).

The situation is different for a WAV file, because in this case there is only
one stream handled by a Packetizer (which will become a fake one), which causes
problems (since in this case the Reader doesn't have anything to give to OGMuxer
while the AVIReader still have the video stream).
To solve this the WAVReader is removed from the list of Readers handled by OGMuxer.
