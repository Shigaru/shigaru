27.11.2002
Version 1.1a2
 - streams coming from AVI (except video) or OGM file can be excluded for the final OGM
   thanks to a new option in the .omx file (latest format)

10.11.2002
Version 1.1a1
 - now use a (really) basic XML-like parser to read the setup file (you are not bound to
   the former strict use of this setup file concerning section presence and formatting)
 - you can use another type of setup file with some new features : frames where to cut
   , offset, proper comments, filetype forcing, ...
   See OGMuxer.txt for more information (and Setup-New.omx for an example)
 - fixed a bug occuring when cutting subtitles in very specific circunstances and resulting
   in last part(s) being unplayable

01.11.2002
Version 1.0a10
 - fixed a bug making DVobSub write subtitles one on another

27.10.2002
Version 1.0a9
 - fixed some bugs regarding subtitles cutting
 
24.10.2002
Version 1.0a8
 - titles are managed more efficiently (see OGMuxer.txt)

21.10.2002
Version 1.0a7
 - fixed a bug where TITLE was renamed "... - Part 1 - Part %n" when splitting

20.10.2002
Version 1.0a6
 - fixed a bug concerning the use of --frames "..." in certain cases

18.10.2002
Version 1.0a5
 - fixed a problem when using 0 as split size in the .omx file
 - fixed a bug causing OGMuxer generating invalid Vorbis streams when cutting
 - fixed a bug causing first part containing all chapters (even those not
   belonging to this first part)

14.10.2002
Version 1.0a4
 - forgot to allow split in .omx file :p
 
13.10.2002
Version 1.0a3
 - changed the order in which file type is tested to avoid some very rare cases
   where a SRT file containing specific characters (Cyrillic, ...) could be badly
   treated as being an MP3 or AC3 file
 - some minor bug fixes
 
07.10.2002
Version 1.0a2
 - fixed a bug where OGMuxer would loop doing nothing while opening input files
 - fixed a bug causing OGMuxer to crash when using an omx file
 - fixed a bug causing error when using a Vorbis stream
 - changed some things in header declarations for MP3 and AC3 streams

04.10.2002
Version 1.0a1
 - fixed another bug that could have caused problems when using OGM (with more than
   1 stream) file as input
 - added the possibility to cut the resulting OGM file according to a split size,
   frames you specified, or both (see OGMuxer.txt for more information).
   This works similarly to OGMCutter.
 
02.10.2002
Version 0.9a6
 - fixed what could have caused problems when using OGM (with more than 1 stream)
   file as input
 - added a lazy mode for Emp3r0r :p : you can precise the Setup file as unique option
   thus allowing drag'n'drop of such Setup file
 - (great) internal rework
 - seems a little faster to process now :)
 - added WAV format for input
 - will now process all audio streams coming from an AVI file
 - can "reprocess" audio streams coming from an AVI or WAV file (instead of just
   writing the data as is, reprocess them regarding their type - valid for MP3 or
   AC3 streams in AVI and WAV files)
   Nb : This is of great help when the audio stream is a VBR one :) (on my test
   reprocessing fixes a synchronisation problem I have when not using reprocessing)
   See OGMuxer.txt for more information.

26.09.2002
Version 0.9a5
 - added the possiblity to test if an input file is of a known type
 - fixed a problem causing comments (coming from Setup file) to be applied
   to all the streams in an ogm file (now only apply to the video for title
   and to audio when language)

20.09.2002
Version 0.9a4
 - corrected a little bug regarding multichannel Vorbis streams

18.09.2002
Version 0.9a3
 - try to be more compliant with Ogg and OggDS

12.09.2002
Version 0.9a2
 - fixed memory leak (version 0.9a1)
 - added some code coming from OggMux (automatisation setup file parsing)
 - added some tools (reading routines) coming from VirtualDub 1.4.10 for opening AVI files
   thus replacing the AVILib use (because of its 2GB limit), and breaking the 2GB limit
   (at least in theory)

06.09.2002
Version 0.9a1 (non public release)
 - internal rework
 - added buffering for input and output files (except for AVILib) to speed up the process
 - added comments for input streams (internally)

04.09.2002
Version 0.9
 - first public release
