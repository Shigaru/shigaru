MeWiG - MEncoder GUI for Windows
--------------------------------


What is it all about?
- MEncoder is a command-line driven video-transcoding-tool and part of the 
  MPlayer-suite ( http://www.mplayerhq.hu ).
  MeWiG helps you to control Mencoder without the need to memorize all the options.

What do I need to use MeWiG?
- The latest Release of MeWiG ( http://hco.dyndns.org/mewig )
- The latest Windows-Release of the MPlayer-suite ( http://www.mplayerhq.hu ) 
- The .NET Framework-Runtime ( http://www.microsoft.com/net/ or "Windows-Update" )
- Videos to transcode (anything the mplayer can read/play)

It doesn't work! (Nothing happens when pressing the "Encode"-Button.)
- Did you set the Path to mplayer/mencoder under Files->Settings ?

I don't take any responsibilty for damage/data loss/lethal accidents that may happen, when using this software.
